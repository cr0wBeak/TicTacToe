# TicTacToe
This file was made purely as practice for two things: making a WinForms app using Visual Studio, and uploading a repository for GitHub. I've done this as a means to practice for my college's C# class. 

## How to Use
Click one of the grey squares to place an X or an O. The game will not automatically detect if someone has won the game; this may or may not be changed in a future update.
To reset the game, click the reset button at the bottom. This will clear the board and make it X's turn.
